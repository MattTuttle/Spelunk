_UPDATE: Migrated to Haxe 3 & OpenFL. Tested with OpenFL 1.0.4 & HaxePunk 2.3.2._

*Matt Tuttle:* I originally wrote this game back when HaxePunk was Flash only. The sound effects are in mp3 format only so to actually get this working you might need to export the effects as wav files. The code compiles for native targets though and should work in HaxePunk 2.2.0.
